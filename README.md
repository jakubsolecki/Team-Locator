# Team-Locator

Team-Locator is a Python Kivy-based app made for better coordination of outdoor games. The idea is simple: each of the players can see other teammates' actual postions on smartphone.
Simply run the app, create username, provide token obtained from game supervisor and hit connect. That's it! Now you're able to see all your teammates' positions in real time.
